## About 

The purpose of this project is to see if TFBS presence is correlated with enhancer function.

## Tasks:

0. Make sure Jupyter notebook makes sense and is clear to you. Fix or clarify with a new pull request.

1. Use the [juptyer notebook](https://github.com/DiscoveryDNA/map_motif/blob/master/code/Motif_Scoring_and_Extraction.ipynb) to map TFBS on sequences. 
	- specify threshold .95
	- output Species: VT17018|0|**MEMB002A**|-|1115
	- alignment_file: align_outlier_rm_with_length_**VT17018**.fa
	- postion: remove
	- seq_length: remove

2. For input
    -  Start with 500 seq. The data is located in google drive folder: [3_24_species_only_alignments.zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19LV8QSPFbsEvglt785RUDKcxHoOiQ5rX).  
    -  pwm are located in the /data folder in this repo.
